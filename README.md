# Trans-Omics Acceleration Library

## Introduction
The Trans-Omics Acceleration Library (TAL) contains key modules for Trans-Omics analysis that are optimized for Xeon.

The contributors to TAL are Sanchit Misra, Vasimuddin Md, Saurabh Kalikar, Narendra Chaudhary and Kanak Mahadik.

The following block diagram illustrates the building blocks and applications available in TAL.
