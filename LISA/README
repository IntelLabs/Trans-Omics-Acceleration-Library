## Introduction
LISA provides learned indexes based optimized implementations of two key kernels: exact-search and smem-search.

The contributors to LISA are Saurabh Kalikar, Sanchit Misra and Darryl Ho.

## Getting Started
```sh
git clone --recursive <REPO URL>
make
cd LISA
make lisa
```

## LISA index building
Learned hash-table uses an external training library that runs on Rust.
Install Rust <i> https://rustup.rs/ </i> and add installation path to .bashrc file. 

1. Build forward-only LISA index (for exact search).
./build-index-forward-only-lisa.o full-path-to-ref_file K num_rmi_leaf_nodes

2. Build LISA index for SMEM search.
scripts/build-lisa-smem-index.sh full-path-to-ref_file K num_rmi_leaf_nodes
